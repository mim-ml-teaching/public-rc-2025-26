We have two identical pinhole cameras with focal lengths (both) `5` and optical centers `x = 300`, `y = 200`. Cameras have no distortions.

1. What is the camera matrix?
2. Let's assume two cameras' optic axes are parallel and the second camera is shifted by `x=0,y=1,z=0` with respect to the first camera. What is the pixel disparity (distance in pixels) between the points on images that correspond to a point in the 3D space with coordinates `(5, 5, 5)` with respect to first camera.
